    âœ… Part 1: 10 pts - Write code in a function named part1()
  </summary>
  
  - Write a while loop that will generate random integer between 4 and 10 until the user presses 0 (zero)
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
    âœ… Part 2: 20 pts - Write code in a function named part2()
  </summary>

  - The file movies.txt has data in the format movie id, movie name, movie year and movie rating separated by `;`
  - read movies.txt into a multidimensional list
  - ask user to provide movie name
  - look for the movie name in the multidimensional list (use case-insensitive comparision)
  - if found,
    - ask user to enter rating (rating must be float value between 2 and 10)
    - change the rating for that movie to the user entered value
  - else, print movie not found
  - write the updated list to a new file named movies2.txt in the same `;` delimited format
  - Handle any and all exceptions
</details>

    âœ… Part 3: 20 pts - Write code in a function named part3()
  </summary>

  Dictionary Structure: movies.pkl stores a nested dictionary  
  - the keys of this dictionary are movie IDs in `string` format
  - the value is a dictionary as follows
    - `name` -> movie_name (string)
    - `year` -> movie_year (string)
    - `rating` -> movie_rating (string)
    - `cast` -> the cast of the movie (set)

  <summary>
    Operations
  </summary>

  1. Unpickle the movies.pkl file which has a dictionary
  2. For the movie Shawshank Redemption, add a new key/value pair, key is `cast` and value is a set with two elements `Morgan Freeman` and `Tim Robbins`
  3. Change Forrest Gump year to 1994 (make sure you conform to the existing datatypes) and add actor Gary Sinise to the cast (make sure you don't erase any existing cast)
  4. Change all movie ratings' datatypes (if available) to floats
  5. Ask the user to input a movie name, if found (case-insensitive search), ask the user to enter one cast and add the new cast to the movie, without erasing any previous cast. The new cast name must have first letter of each word capitalized.
  6. Pickle the modified dictionary to `movies2.pkl`

    âœ… Part 4: 30 pts
  </summary>

- In `classes.py`, create three classes using the diagram provided in part4 - inheritance diagram 

- In `functions.py` in part4() function body
  1.	Create four variables id = `3045`, name = `Harry Wilks`, cert_level = `AUD-L1`, salary = `75000` (Choose your data types)
  2.	Create new pilot object using the above variables, and name it pilot1 
  4.	Change pilot1â€™s salary to 85000
  5.	Get pilot1â€™s cert_level and print it
  6.	Print all the details of pilot1  
  
  7.	Create new mechanic object, name it mechanic1 using id = `3980`, name = `Ian West`, salary = `55000`, specialization = `aerofoil`
  8.	Change mechanic1â€™s specialization to `wing engineering`
  9.	Get mechanic1â€™s name and print it
  10.	Print all the details of mechanic1

    âœ… Part 5: 20 pts - Write code in a function named part5()
  </summary>

- Connect to the database movies.db
- Write a CREATE statement that creates a table named movies with 4 columns (you may choose the names for the columns)
  - id is an integer and a primary key
  - name is string
  - year is integer
  - rating is float
- it should not raise any exception
- Open the file movies.txt and read it and insert that data into the table you created using INSERT statements (After executing correctly, comment out just this code)
- Display all the movie data in a nice tabular format sorted by name
- Display the lowest rating
- Display the year of the most recent movie
- Change the rating of the movie, the good, the bad and the ugly to 10
- Change the year of Forrest Gump to 1994
- Delete any movies who have rating lower than 9 and print how many were deleted
- Close the connection
